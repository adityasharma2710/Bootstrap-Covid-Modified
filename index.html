                     <h2>About Corona Virus </h2>
                     <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br>

                        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
                        
                        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. <br>
                        
                        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

This could include the school grounds in some situations. Masks may help to protect others, because wearers may be infected before symptoms of illness appear.

                            "No one was allowed to come and see me," she says. "It was a very lonely, dark time. I was bed-bound for two or three days. I couldn't even go to the toilet. If they needed to change the bed sheets, they would have to turn me over.

                           Jessie Clark from Sheffield knew she would be vulnerable if she contracted Covid-19 - she has chronic kidney disease and five years ago had a kidney removed. When the 26-year-old started coughing and becoming increasingly breathless she started to worry. Within days, she was struggling to walk.

                              "I also had a lot of pain in my ribs, back and abdomen," explains Jessie. "I felt like I had been beaten up."
                              <br>
                                 Two days after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the UK was going into lockdown, Jessie's fiance Tom drove her to A&E. They were quickly separated because of safety restrictions.

                                 "I was scared to be alone, but I was so poorly I just wanted someone to help me," Jessie says. "I was given a green mask with a wired bit around the nose to keep it up. I was taken to a unit which seemed to be being used for Covid-19 patients. Social distancing was in place so we had bays separated by walls with a bed in each bay.
                              <br>
                                 "I wasn't tested for Covid-19. My doctor told they 'couldn't swab everyone, but it was safe to assume I had it'. He said the pain I was experiencing was the inflammation from my lungs and that I should keep self-isolating and taking painkillers.

                           Stewart Boyle is almost certain he contracted coronavirus at one of his choir meetings a few weeks ago.
                           
                           "We were all social distancing when we met on the Thursday, but by Sunday a high number of people had come down with flu-like symptoms," he says.

                              "It was like something out of a movie," he says. "I was wheeled into the 'red zone' and there were loads of tests being carried out and swabs being taken. They thought I had coronavirus so they upped my oxygen. There were a couple of hours where I was within a whisper of a very dark place and I thought, 'maybe my time is up'. But I wanted to live.
                              <br>
                              "I could feel the battle in my lungs and it required all my reserves to get through it. The extra oxygen gave my lungs a break and gave me the added energy to push out the disease. The NHS staff were incredible, but all they can do is help you fight the virus. There's no vaccination or magical potion that can save you. It's about your own resilience."

                           The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
                           expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
                           from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
                           people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                           particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
                           possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
                           a mild cough and does not feel ill.

                           have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
                           situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
